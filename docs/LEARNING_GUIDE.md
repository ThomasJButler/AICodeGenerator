## Architecture Decisions

### Why This Stack?

**Backend: FastAPI + LangChain + Tree-sitter**
- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its modern Python async support, automatic API documentation, and excellent performance
- **LangChain**: Provides robust AI orchestration and prompt management
- **Tree-sitter**: Industry-standard parser for accurate code analysis across languages

**Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind**
- **Next.js**: React framework with excellent DX and built-in optimizations
- **TypeScript**: Type safety catches errors early and improves maintainability
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with utility-first approach

### System Design Philosophy

```
User Input → Frontend Dashboard → API Gateway → AI Services → Response
                                                      ↓
                                              Code Analysis
```

The separation of concerns ensures:
- Frontend focuses purely on user experience
- Backend handles all business logic and AI operations
- Services are modular and independently scalable

## Backend Development Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation (30 minutes)

**Starting Point**: Empty repository

**First Decision**: Project structure
```
backend/
├── api/           # Endpoints layer
├── services/      # Business logic
├── models/        # Data structures
└── config.py      # Central configuration
```

This structure separates concerns clearly:
- API layer handles HTTP concerns
- Services contain reusable business logic
- Models define data contracts

### Phase 2: Core Services (45 minutes)

**Challenge**: How to integrate multiple AI services effectively?

**Solution**: Service layer pattern
```python
class CodeGeneratorService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(...)

    async def generate_code(self, request):
        # Isolated business logic
        prompt = self._create_prompt(request)
        code = await self._generate(prompt)
        return code
```

**Key Learning**: Abstracting LLM interactions into services makes testing and swapping providers easier.

### Phase 3: Prompt Engineering (30 minutes)

**Discovery**: Prompt quality dramatically affects output quality.

**Approach**: Structured prompt templates
```python
def _create_code_prompt(self, request):
    return """You are an expert programmer...

    Requirements:
    1. Code must be syntactically correct
    2. Follow best practices for {language}
    3. Include proper error handling
    """
```

**Insight**: Explicit requirements in prompts lead to more consistent results.

### Phase 4: Code Analysis Integration (45 minutes)

**Challenge**: Validating generated code across multiple languages

**Solution**: Tree-sitter provides language-agnostic parsing
```python
def _check_syntax(self, code, language):
    parser = self.parsers[language]
    tree = parser.parse(bytes(code, "utf8"))
    # Walk tree to find syntax errors
```

**Learning**: Using established tools (Tree-sitter) instead of building custom parsers saves weeks of work.

## Frontend Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Design System (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Create a unique, memorable user experience

**Matrix Theme Decision**:
- Differentiates from typical coding tools
- Reinforces "hacker" aesthetic developers enjoy
- Terminal-style interface feels natural for code

**Implementation**: CSS custom properties for consistency
```css
:root {
  --matrix-green: #00ff00;
  --matrix-bg: #000000;
  --terminal-font: 'Courier New', monospace;
}
```

### Phase 2: Component Architecture (45 minutes)

**Pattern**: Composition over inheritance
```typescript
// Small, focused components
<Dashboard>
  <PromptInput />
  <LanguageSelector />
  <ResultsDisplay>
    <CodeDisplay />
    <TestDisplay />
  </ResultsDisplay>
</Dashboard>
```

**Benefit**: Each component has a single responsibility, making the codebase maintainable.

### Phase 3: State Management (30 minutes)

**Decision**: Local state with React hooks

**Why not Redux/Context?**
- Application state is relatively simple
- Most state is local to dashboard
- Reduces complexity for future developers

```typescript
const [results, setResults] = useState<GenerationResult[]>([]);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'code'|'tests'|'docs'>('code');
```

### Phase 4: API Integration (30 minutes)

**Pattern**: Centralized API configuration
```typescript
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000/api';

const handleGenerate = async () => {
  const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/generate`, data);
  // Handle response
};
```

**Learning**: Environment variables make deployment configuration seamless.

## Integration Patterns

### Error Handling Strategy

**Backend**: Structured error responses
```python
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=400,
    detail="Detailed error message"
)
```

**Frontend**: User-friendly error display
```typescript
catch (err) {
  setError(err.response?.data?.detail || 'Generation failed');
}
```

### Real-time Feedback

**Loading States**: Keep users informed
```typescript
{loading ? <MatrixLoader /> : 'GENERATE CODE'}
```

**Progress Indicators**: Show system is working
- Animated loading dots
- Glitch effects during processing
- Clear success/error states

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start with the API Contract
Defining request/response models first ensures frontend and backend teams can work in parallel.

### 2. Invest in Developer Experience
- Comprehensive type definitions save debugging time
- Good error messages accelerate development
- API documentation (FastAPI's auto-docs) is invaluable

### 3. Iterate on Prompts
First prompt attempts rarely produce ideal results. Budget time for prompt refinement.

### 4. Design for Failure
- Network requests will fail
- AI responses may be incomplete
- Always have fallback UI states

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Implement request debouncing
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Lazy load heavy dependencies

3. **Add user authentication** to save generation history
4. **Create a CLI tool** for developers who prefer terminal interfaces
5. **Add more language-specific optimizations** in prompt templates
